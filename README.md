## 📖 Project Description

Many students currently struggle to find part-time jobs, often relying on WhatsApp groups where **brokers** reduce earnings and create trust issues.

**WorkZone** was developed to solve this problem by connecting **students and companies directly**, ensuring fair pay, transparency, and trust.

### Key Objectives
* ✅ **Centralized Platform:** A dedicated hub for student jobs.
* ✅ **Direct Interaction:** No intermediaries between students and companies.
* ✅ **Fair & Transparent:** Students receive their full earnings.
* ✅ **Secure System:** A safe environment for all users.

## ✨ Main Features

* 🔐 **Secure Authentication:** Robust login systems for both Students and Companies.
* 📋 **Job Management:** Easy job posting and management for companies.
* 🎓 **Student Applications:** Seamless job application process for students.
* 📱 **Responsive UI:** Modern, mobile-friendly design built with **Tailwind CSS**.
* 🚫 **Broker-Free:** Direct connections ensuring maximum earnings for students.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
* **DevOps:** GitHub Actions, Shell Scripting, Vercel/Render
* **Tools:** Git, VS Code, Postman

## 🌳 Branching Strategy

We implemented the following branching strategy to ensure code quality:

* `main` - **Production Branch**: Auto-deployed to live server.
* `develop` - **Integration Branch**: All features are merged here first.
* `feature/*` - **Feature Branches**: Individual branches for each developer.

> **Workflow:** Feature -> Develop (Testing) -> Main (Production)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
* **Git** installed

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AnjanaMadhushanaj/WorkZone.git](https://github.com/AnjanaMadhushanaj/WorkZone.git)
    cd workzone
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    # Install Backend
    cd backend
    npm install

    # Install Frontend
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    # Run Backend (Port 5000)
    npm run dev

    # Run Frontend (Port 5173/3000)
    npm run dev
    ```

### 🔄 Deployment Process (CI/CD)
Our project uses **GitHub Actions** for automation:
1.  **CI Pipeline:** Triggers on pull requests to `develop` or `main`. It installs dependencies, builds the project, and runs tests.
2.  **Deployment:** Triggers **only** when changes are merged into `main`. It automatically deploys the latest code to the production server.

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
* **CORS Errors:** We faced issues connecting Frontend to Backend due to CORS policies, resolved by configuring the `cors` package in Express.
* **Merge Conflicts:** Encountered conflicts in `package.json` when merging branches, resolved by manual code review.

## 🐳 Docker Containerisation

### Prerequisites
* **Docker** (v20.10 or later)
* **Docker Compose** (v2.0 or later; included with Docker Desktop)

### Project Structure (Docker files)

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `frontend/Dockerfile` | Multi-stage build definition for the React frontend (served via Nginx) |
| `backend/Dockerfile` | Build definition for the Node.js Express API |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Service orchestration for the full MERN application stack |
| `.dockerignore` | Excludes unnecessary files (like `node_modules`) from the Docker build context |

### Building and Running

Start the entire application stack in detached (background) mode with a single command:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
Once running, the applications will be available at:Frontend: http://localhost:8080Backend API: http://localhost:5000Stop the application (preserves data):Bashdocker compose stop
Stop and remove all containers, networks, and data (including the database volume):Bashdocker compose down -v
Environment VariablesThese variables are explicitly managed within the docker-compose.yml file for secure configuration:VariableDefault ValueDescriptionPORT5000Internal port the Express server listens onMONGO_URImongodb://mongodb:27017/workzoneConnection string for the isolated MongoDB containerVITE_API_URLhttp://localhost:5000The backend API URL injected into the frontend during the build phaseDocker Architecture HighlightsBase Images: node:20-alpine and nginx:alpine — extremely lightweight Alpine Linux images to minimize storage footprint and reduce the attack surface.Multi-stage Builds: Separates build-time dependencies from the runtime environment in the frontend, significantly reducing the final image size (down to ~93.7 MB).Non-root User: The backend application runs as an unprivileged user (node), adhering to the security principle of least privilege.Custom Networking: All three containers (Frontend, Backend, Database) communicate securely over an isolated, custom internal bridge network (network).Named Volume (mongodb_data): Persists the MongoDB database records, ensuring data is not lost across container restarts
